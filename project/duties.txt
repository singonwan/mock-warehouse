Esther Kim
- created class WarehouseManager.java, FaxMachine.java, PickUpRequest.java
- made unit test for FaxMachine.java
- Debugged null pointers in WarehouseManager.java
- Run through the program in the CDF machines
Phase 2:
- created and changed code for methods to implement rescan
- added more test cases for warehouseManagerTest, faxMachineTest
- fixing checkstyle for code, add more javadoc for new methods
- changes for code in WarehouseManager
- more implementation for logging
==============================================================
George Wan
- WareHouse Reader class
- WareHouseFloor class
- Location class
- Truck class
- Pallet iterator design
- Created JUnit Tests for Truck
- Debugged program
- read arguments from command line
- change implementation of warehouse reader to take in file
better for testing
- change wareHouseFloor from hard code to go through traversal table
- traversal table will be taken in as second argument
- overwrite equals method for warehouse
- method to get amount from a specific rack
- more testing 
==============================================================
Ross West
Phase 1:
- Created the worker class, Worker.java
- Created the worker subclasses: Picker, Sequencer, Loader, and Replenisher.
- Created Unit Tests for Picker, Sequencer, Loader, and Replenisher
- Created Unit Tests for Pallet (not really necessary...?)
- Created Unit Tests for PickUpRequest
- Created Unit Tests for BarecodeReader
- Created Unit Tests for WarehouseFloor
Phase 2:
- Removed a bunch of static variables
- Commented a couple of static variables that were not removed
- Added a few unit tests (particularly for WarehouseSystem)
- Added Javadoc in some places where it was missing
- Modified CheckerTest to get one more line of code covered
- Modified TruckTest to get a bunch more branches covered
- Fixed a couple of IndexOutOfBoundsException problems in FaxMachineTest
- Added rescan documentation to help.txt
==============================================================
Sharene Thio
- Created all checkers, BarcodeReader.java, Pallet.java, WarehouseSystem.java
- Modified workers to work with the BarcodeReader
- Modified PickUpRequest.java to hold additional information on what stage it is on
- Edited WarehouseManager.java to interact properly with PickUpRequest, workers and BarcodeReader
- Created JUnit Tests and ensure all JUnit Tests has been covered
- Help debug program
Phase 2:
- Changed the program so that pickers re-pick when sequencers get the wrong order
- Created the logger
- Added logging statements where needed
- Create a simulation method for sequencer to sequence incorrectly
- Check javadoc and format for the classes
- Changed the 16orders.txt
- Rewrite JUnit Tests to accommodate changes from 16orders.txt
- Add more Junit Tests
- Debugged problems in Truck.java
- Final edit on help.txt
